            <summary>How do I use FrontPage 2003 to publish to my Website?</summary>
            <p class="para"> Microsoft FrontPage software provides a user-friendly way to create and manage professional quality web sites. It features easy-to-use WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing tools and wizards to walk you through the creation of your site<br>
                <br>
                From within FrontPage 2003, follow these steps:<br>
                <br>
                1.Click File and choose Open Web.<br>
                2.Locate the web that you have created on your hard drive by using the Look In box. If you have not yet created a web, then you will not be able to publish. To create a FrontPage web on your computer, click File and choose New Web.<br>
                3.Highlight the web that you wish to publish, and click Open.<br>
                4.Now click File again and choose Publish Web. A window will appear asking for the destination of this web. Please enter:<br>
                       http://www.domainname.com<br>
                (Please note: Your domain name registration must be completed and pointed to our nameservers before you will be able to upload your pages.)<br>
                5.When prompted, enter your username in format username and password. Now that you have logged into the server, FrontPage will begin to publish your new web site to the server.</p>

            <summary>Can I use the FTP feature in FrontPage 2003?</summary>
            <p class="para">Yes, this is possible but we do not recommend it. If you wish to use FrontPage 2003 to edit your site, it is best to use the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) publishing method to upload your site. If you chose to publish using the FTP feature you will need to verify in your FrontPage Manager that your FrontPage extensions are NOT installed. 
                To use FTP to publish your site from within FrontPage 2003, follow these steps:<br>
                <br>
                1.Click File and choose Open Web.<br>
                2.Use the Look In box to locate the web that you have created on your hard drive. If you have not yet created a web, then you will not be able to publish. To create a FrontPage web on your computer, click File and choose New Web.<br>
               3. Highlight the web that you wish to publish, and click Open.<br>
                4.Now click File again and choose Publish Web. A window will appear asking for the destination of this web. Please enter: ftp://ftp.domainname.com<br>
                (Please note: Your domain name registration must be completed and must point to our nameservers before you will be able to upload your pages.)<br>
               5. When prompted, enter your username in format alpha1teclabs/username and password. Now that you have logged in to the server, FrontPage will begin to publish your new web site to the server.</p>

            <summary>Do I need Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Server Extensions to publish my site?</summary>
            <p class="para"> You only need to install the Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Server Extensions if you are using FrontPage to create your web site. If you are using some other web design program, you will not need to install the Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Server Extensions. If you are using FrontPage to create your web site, 
                here's why you need to use FrontPage 2003 Server Extensions as well:<br>
                <br>
                    <li >
                Without the Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Server Extensions, certain features of your site will not work, such as most form handlers, search forms, hit counters, and component features. Your web will not have full FrontPage functionality when it is published without the server extensions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li >
                FrontPage will maintain your files and hyperlinks. Each time you publish your site, FrontPage compares the files on your local computer to the files on the web server.

            <summary>Which versions of FrontPage will the FrontPage Server Extensions be able to support?</summary>
            <p class="para"> The FrontPage Server Extensions provided in your account are compatible with the 97, 98, 2000, 2002 and 2003 versions of FrontPage. Though we do recommend you are better using FrontPage 2003. You should be able to use all three versions successfully with your account.</p>
