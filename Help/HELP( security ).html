            <summary>How to protect yourself from hackers?</summary>
            <p class="para"> Protect yourself from hackers make sure you have the latest versions of Java and Adobe Reader, Flash and Shockwave player installed.
                To find out if you have Java installed and check what version you may be running, Windows users can click Start, then Run, then type “cmd” without the quotes. At the command prompt, type “java -version” (again, no quotes). Users can also visit Java.com and click the “Do I have Java?” link on the homepage. Updates are also available via the Java Control Panel or from Java.com.<br>
                <br>
                Secure Adobe Reader, in Adobe Reader click Edit and then Preferences. Under JavaScript clear checkbox to disable Adobe Reader's ability to run dangerous JavaScript from a PDF. Under Security (Enhanced), another checkbox helps to secure the application. The Trust Manager category allows you to disable Acrobat's ability to call external applications to handle non-PDF files.<br>
                <br>
                Make sure you are using the latest version of Internet Explorer (IE10 is the latest), note: IE9 cannot be installed on XP, IE8 is the latest version for XP which will provide you with enhanced security protection such as DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), and XSS cross scripting protection. Ensure "SmartScreen Filter" is enabled in the IE Menu bar, Tools and you are running in "Protected Mode: On" shown in IE status bar. From IE10 onwards you can enable Tracking Protection in the IE Menu bar, Tools to help protect your privacy.<br>
                <br>
                If you use Mozilla Firefox always ensure you have the latest version, for extra protection you could install add-on NoScript which blocks JavaScript and Java which allows you to run for trusted domains of your choice. Another popular add-on is Adblock Plus which blocks advertising and tracking.<br>
                <br>
                Disable Autorun/Autoplay for all removable media drives. Most malware applications spread because of the Autorun feature, which automatically executes a said file mentioned in the autorun.inf file when you insert a CD/DVD or USB flash drive. For example in Windows 7 this can be found start run, Gpedit.msc, under Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ AutoPlay Polices.</p>

            <summary>Why do I get error: "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item"?</summary>
            <p class="para"> A high security setting in Internet explorer security zone may stop some explorer .exe programs from executing or it may give you an error you do not have correct permissions. Typical Microsoft popup error: "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item". Another symptom is unable to adjust security Internet zone setting, set to high. Check your Internet security zone and if set to high set to medium-high or medium. If you are unable to adjust the Internet zone or there is only high option you then need to locate the zone 3 Internet zone in the registry using regedit<br>
                 <br>
                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\<3> and adjust the Minlevel from high (0x00012000) to medium (0x00011000). This will then allow you to reset the zone to medium.</p>
