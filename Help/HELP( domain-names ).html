                <summary> What is a domain name?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        It's a unique name that identifies an Internet web site, so people can find and visit; its the same as your telephone number, without a number no one would be able to call you. Another advantage is if you ever change internet service providers (ISPs) in the future you won't need to change your email address each time. Domain Names always have 2 or more parts, separated by dots, like "yourname.com", "house.net", "tree.org".

                <p class="para"> 
                        You or your client (if you are registering it on someone else's behalf). You specify at the time of ordering who you want to be listed as the registrant. At no time do we own the domain name. It is very important if you are the actual owner that your name or company name is always listed in whois as the registrant. We have sadly experienced customers held to ransom with providers and web designers whose customers have fallen out with. Our policy is always to register the actual owner rather than any third party unless instructed to do so by the owner.

                <summary> Why should people register domain names?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        Just like a company logo, a brand name, your domain name too represents your business identity. Its like a personalised car number plate it is unique, it helps you stand out from the crowd. Having your own domain name can be for life, it is easily portable, and it is not affected if you change ISP providers. Domain names are designed for people, IP addresses are designed for computers. If you want people to find your web site easily, you will need a domain name. We recommend you choose a domain name that represents your business and the products and services you offer. The easier your domain name is to pronounce, the easier it will be to remember.

                <summary> What are the most popular domain names?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        The most popular cherished sought after domain names end in .com, while .co.uk is also very popular.<br>
                        <br>
                        A .UK domain name says you do business in the UK and 4 out of 5 internet users prefer .UK results when searching on-line, a great indication of trust in the domain â€“ it really has never been a better time to get your business on-line and .UK is great place for it to be.<br>
                        <br>
                        We recommend you purchase both types of domain endings to promote and secure your business website identity. When choosing a domain name it is best to choose a memorable name. You could also register additional domain combinations such as an abbreviation of your company name as well as your full company name including with and without hyphens to secure your company name, website branding, thus protecting against future confusing similar competitor registrations and domain squatters.<br>
                        <br>
                        Some companies even register misspelt domain names of their domain name. Domain names that are misspelt or spelt similar are then redirected to the main domain name web site. Other companies register all available extensions:  .com, .co.uk, .net, .info, .biz, .org, etc. If your domain name is unavailable try using dashes , i.e. www.your-own-domain.com (they can also show up higher in search engines).

                <summary> What is the difference between domain name extensions?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        The domain suffixes basically differentiate between the various types of organizations on the Internet. Generally, the following rules apply:
Top-Level Domains (TLD)<br>
.com -- businesses and commercial enterprises worldwide, can also, be used for personal sites.<br>
.net   -- network-related organizations and enterprises worldwide.<br>
.org   -- charitable or non-profit organizations worldwide.<br>
.info  -- is for anybody that wants to share information on the Net.<br>
.biz   -- Restricted to business and commerce worldwide only.<br>
.mobi -- It is a top level domain dedicated to delivering the internet to the mobile phone. Applicants must agree to follow the 'Switch On!' style guides provided by the registry. The guides contain a set of mandatory and recommended best practices for developing mobile content and services, and compliance with these guides will be periodically checked by the registry. http://mtld.mobi/<br>
You can test your .mobi website at http://ready.mobi/<br>
.name   -- is for personal sites (composed of a first and last name).<br>
.tel -- is a domain service that holds all contact details, for more info visit http://www.telnic.org/.<br>
<br>
Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLD)<br>
.uk -- is the new shorter, sharper domain now available for registration in the UK.<br>
.co.uk -- is for the registration of names relating to commercial enterprises in the UK.<br>
.me.uk -- The me.uk Second Level Domain is intended for personal use. Domain Name registrations made under .uk are expected to be made for natural persons, such as Mr John Doe registering johndoe.me.uk<br>
.org.uk -- It is for organisations which do not 'fit' into any of the other Second Level Domains of the .uk Top Level Domain. These may include: charities, trades unions, political parties, community groups, educational councils, professional institutions, etc.<br>
.ltd.uk  and .plc.uk -- Restricted, to Private Limited Companies and Public Limited Companies only. In order to register the registrant must be (for .ltd.uk) a 'Limited Company' incorporated under the Companies Act 1985, or (for .plc.uk) a 'Public Limited Company' incorporated under the Companies Act 1985; and<br>
The domain name registered by the applicant must be related to their company name in accordance with the algorithm set out in the rules.<br>
Most companies that are entitled to use the word 'Limited', 'Public Limited Company', 'Ltd.' or 'Plc.' in their name are created in this way. Applications are checked by hand, so will take longer than .co.uk or .me.uk applications.<br>
.be -- Country domain for Belgium, useful for relevant local market information about your products and services.<br>
.co -- Country domain originally reserved for Colombia, now used as an abbreviation for company, corporation, commerce, and collaboration, .CO domain names are memorable and short.<br>
.eu -- Anyone based in the European Union can register a .eu domain as long as it is available.<br>
.me -- is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Montenegro http://www.domain.me/.<br>
<br>
The domain name suffix type itself has no bearing on accessibility on the Internet from a technical standpoint, but over time the .com domain type has become the most popular, sought after and recognizable on the Internet today.

                <p class="para"> 
                        You can use any combination of 26 letters in English alphabet, numbers from 0 to 9 and one "-" (hyphen) character. You can cannot start or end a domain name with a hyphen, domains are not case sensitive. Special characters, like the underscore "_", the exclamation mark "!" or the "@" sign, are not permitted as part of your domain name. No profanity or use of any name protected by trademark. One and two letter domain names are not allowed. The only characters (barring letters and numbers) that can be used in Domain Names are hyphens. Domain names cannot contain spaces.

                <summary> Can I have more then one domain name pointing to the same website?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        Yes, we support multiple domain names pointing to the same website, this is often referred to as a domain alias or domain redirect. Domain alias is faster while domain redirect can be slower, but better for search engines. For example domain aliasing is useful if you have two domain names ending in .com and .co.uk, both would take a visitor to the exact same pages of your the website; while another example could be to handle typo errors.

                <p class="para"> 
                        Generally, if you've registered the name in good faith, it's not a name belonging to an internationally known company, and you can show that you have a legitimate reason to use that name then you are likely to be able to keep that name. That may not be the case if it can be shown that you purchased the name for the express purpose of re-selling it to a company with a legitimate claim to the name.

                <p class="para"> 
                        Transferring means changing the registrars. If you have domains that were registered with other registrars such as Network Solutions, you do not have to renew your domain with them. You can transfer the domain to us and renew at our low rates. Transfer needs to be done before the domain name expires. Please see the restrictions below. Transferring a domain name does not mean transfer of ownership; you are still the registered owner.

                <summary>What is required to do a transfer? What are the restrictions?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        In order to transfer a domain name successfully certain criteria's should be met:<br>
                        - A domain name that was registered or renewed less than 60 days ago cannot be transferred. You will just have to wait 60 days before proceeding with a transfer afterwards.<br>
                        - Domain names that are on HOLD cannot be transferred. Registrars can place a domain name on hold, such as domain names that are in dispute between two parties. Until the ownership issue is solved and domain name is taken out of hold it cannot be transferred.<br>
                        - If the existing registrar has the domain name locked for either non-payment or at the user's request domain cannot be transferred. If you have purchased but not paid for a domain name, existing registrar will not permit it to be transferred.<br>
                        - Expired domain names cannot be transferred. Original registrar has the right to refuse the transfer of an expired and unpaid domain. Just to be on the safe side, we require that you should allow a minimum of 30 days prior to expiration date to do the transfer.<br>
                        - All .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .name and .us domains require an authorization code. If you do not know your Auth Code, you can obtain it from your Registrar. Please have it ready before you initiate a Transfer of Registrar.<br>
                        - If you don't have access to existing Admin Contact e-mail of the domain name, transfer cannot be done. The Admin Contact's approval via e-mail is required. If your domain names Admin Contact e-mail is not valid anymore, first you should update it with your existing registrar, and then apply for transfer. Most of our transfer failures occur due to this reason. You can use WHOIS to find out the current admin contact email.<br>
                         Do not attempt to do a transfer if your domain does not meet the requirements. That will result in a rejection and a charge of Â£10.00 processing fee (to cover our cost). Same fee will apply if transfer gets cancelled by Admin Contact either by rejecting or by not replying in 30 days. Transfer Request acceptance from the registry can take anywhere from one to 30 days. You do not pay any processing fee for successful transfers. If a domain transfer is rejected for a different reason, you will not be charged for any fees.

                        Do a WHOIS search for the domain in question. It will show you the date it was registered (created), the date it will expire, whether it is on HOLD or not, and the Admin Contact e-mail. (If the domain was renewed after its original creation date, you should calculate the last renewal date based on the creation date)

                        Unless you try to transfer a domain name that does not meet the above requirements there are no additional costs. Only amount you will be charged is the one year registration fee. This registration will add one year to the existing expiration date of the domain no matter how early you do the transfer. There are some companies that make you pay an additional charge to release the domain for transfer.

                        All .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .name and .us domains require an authorization code. If you do not know your Auth Code, you can obtain it from your Registrar.<br>
1- You submit a transfer request from our transfer page. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the new Admin Contact e-mail.<br>
2- An e-mail for each domain will be sent to the current Admin Contact e-mail address. The Admin Contact of the domain (either yourself or somebody else) will receive also as usual an e-mail message containing a link to the Registrar webpage of which is the start of transfer process which has to be approved. The new issue is that in this webpage the Admin Contact must type in the AUTH-INFO created or set thru the losing registrar website.<br>
3- Then the request will be sent to "loosing" registrar for their approval. This registrar has to approve or reject normally within 5 days. They usually don't wait that long. Your domain will be renewed for one year and the new expiration date will be one year from the last expiration date. The "loosing" registrar may or may not send a confirmation e-mail, indicating whether they approved or rejected the transfer (Network Solutions does send e-mails). If you don't receive an e-mail, using WHOIS you can check the new expiration date of the domain name.

                        Please allow up to 24 hours for root servers of InterNIC to reflect the updates and up to 48 hours for the changes to propagate to entire internet. Domain registry databases can take between 24-48 hours to be updated so even though your domain has been registered it may still show up on WHOIS or "domain checkers" as being available. Global domain names tend to take the longest to show up as being registered due to a new shared registry system.

After this a renewal is due to the local NIC. If you have moved the domain away from us in this time, you will be responsible for keeping up the payment to the local NIC for the domain name. If you bought the name through us, and if we still look after the domain name when it comes time to renew, then you will be sent a reminder e-mail and will be able to renew the domain on-line.

Next is that Admin Contact, this will be whomever you choose to list. The admin contact will be responsible for the overall control if the domain is to be moved so ensure this is an e-mail address that is not going to become obsolete. Next comes the Technical Contact, by default we are listed as the Technical contact as it is us who are running the name servers etc used by the domain name. Finally the Billing Contact, again as it is us that pay the bill to International, it is us that are listed as the billing contact.

                <summary> What is a private domain name registration?</summary>
                <p class="para"> 
                        Private domain name registration is where you can protect your privacy with a private registration. With a standard registration, ICANN regulations require that your private contact information (Name, Address, Email Address, and Phone Number) be included in the publicly accessible whois database. This means that anyone, anywhere has access to your personal data. With a TLD private registration, the registrar's contact information is listed instead of your personal information. A private registration:<br>
                        . Protects your privacy<br>
                        . Shields you from identity theft, stalkers, and fraud<br>
                        . Saves you from domain-related spam<br>
                        <br>
                        For country .uk domain names Nominet provide provide a free registrant whois opt-out field. If the registrant is a personal registration then the registrant can also choose not to have their address details displayed on the whois. In this case the 'opt-out' field should by marked as y. If the 'opt-out' field is marked as n then their address details will be displayed on the whois. The default value is that the registrant is not opted-out.
